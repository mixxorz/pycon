      expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
      religion, status, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
      following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
      events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

    <p>
      Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
      immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other
      exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive
      jokes are not appropriate for PyCon.

    <p>
      Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also
      subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized
      images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
      sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

    <p>
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any
      action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the
      conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
      harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
      immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts/special badges/head sets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local
      law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to
      feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
    </p>

    <p>
      We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and
      conference-related social events.
