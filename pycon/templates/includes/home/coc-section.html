    <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

    <p>
      PyCon PH is a community conference intended for collaboration in the
      developer community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We value the participation of each member of the Python community and
      want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
      Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to
      other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events,
      whether officially sponsored by Python.PH or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers,
      exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any PyCon event are required to
      conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this

    <h3>The long version</h3>

    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
      identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
      appearance, body size, race, religion, status, sexual images in public
      spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
      photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
      inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
      comply immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist,
      and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.
      Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for PyCon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar
      activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
      exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
      material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
      clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers
      may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
      or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being
      harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
      concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts/special badges/head sets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
      security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
      those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
      conference. We value your attendance.
    </p>

    <p>
      We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and
      conference-related social events.
